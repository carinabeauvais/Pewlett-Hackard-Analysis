# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Determine the number of retiring employees based on their title and identify employees who are eligile to participate in a mentorship program to build a program to groom future potential replacements for those that are soon to retire.

### Results
* When looking at the number of employees planning to retire based on titles we can see that there going to be big losses for Senior Engineers and Senior Staff.

* On the bright side there are just about 500,000 employees who would be eligible for a mentorship program.

* While that is a great number the list needs to be filtered by greatest need, so for Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This shows you have a very large gap between what you are going to need to replace soon and what you currently have, especially if you are only looking at a small data set (i.e., those born in 1965 or those above age 55.

* Knowing that you cannot just put anybody in to fill certain roles, it is important to understand the feeder pipeline. For instance Engineers can move fairly easily into a Senior Engineer but general staff or Technique Leaders may not so easily transition into a Senior Staff position without certain training or experience. That will be important to undersand. 

#### Summary

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There are 72,458 employees potentially retiring using the data we have. There could be variation if some staff want to work longer than the typical retirement age or if employees take early retirement. Either way, that is a good number of people will need to replace in the next few years.

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor to the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Not even close. Using such a limited group, in this case those born in 1965, shows you have 1,379 eligible candidates. I highly suggest expanding your candidate pool by beefing up your mentor program and hire a large number of employees as soon as possible to get them trained and ready to go or you will soon be very short staffed. I pulled data for staff born from 1965 through 1995 and still have nowhere near enough candidates. This tells me the majority of your staff are very close to retirement age. Great because they are likely long-term employees, but you need to hire younger employees to backfill and learn the ropes from your more seasoned staff, so you will also want to identify staff who would make great mentors to new employees.
